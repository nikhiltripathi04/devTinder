- initialize git
- .gitignore 
- create a remote repo on github
- push all code to remote origin
- play with routes and route extensions
- order of routes matter a lot
- install postman app and make a workspace/collection -> test API call
- write logic to handle GET,, POST, PATCH, PUT, DELETE and test them on POSTMAN
- explore routing, use of ?, +, (), * in the routes
- use of regex in routes /a/ , /.*fly$/
- reading the query params in the routes
- reading the dynamic routes

- multiple route handlers
- next()
- next function and errors along with res.send()
- app.use("/route", [rH, rH2, rH3, rH4, rH5]);
- what is middleware? why do we need it?
- how express js basically handles requests behind the scenes
- difference b/w app.use and app.all
- write a dummy auth middleware for admin
- write a dummy auth middleware for user except login
- error handling using app.use("/, (err, req, res, next)") => {}) - always towards the end of our application
